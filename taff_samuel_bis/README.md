# Best Practices you must have when you dev a project : 

__**You must give a logic name at your variables.**__

## exemples :

### Not good :
```python
My_Age = 27
istheavatardeadornot = False
the_price_of_the_item = 8.99
``` 
### Good :
```python
age = 25
dead = True
price = 12.99
```

# Best Practices you must have when you dev a dynamic WebSite : 

**__Use CVM architecture__**

![CVM Architecture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/ModeleMVC.png/555px-ModeleMVC.png)

You will separate your Web Site on three files. 

* ##  Controller : Contain the logic about any actions which are do by user.

* ##  View : Contain graphical interface

* ##  Model : contains the information to display

*This architecture can use for every projects. The idea is to have more files to know where we have a problem and change what we want quickly*
